				<h3>A bit of personal history ... </h3>
        <h5>Questions always come up about my past work and education so I thought I'd clarify here.</h5>
        <p>Anyone visiting might hit my LinkedIn profile and see a whole bunch of health and teaching history there and wonder if they reached the right profile. You have. </p>
        <p>Long story short, I have an MD and a Masters of Education. I started off programming since I was a kid but have always had the drive to help people. Because of that, it led me down the road toward my MD. I achieved that goal but I was not able to pass all the US board exams. The consequence of that was that I am not allowed to practice in the United States (but I am a US citizan born and raised).</p>
        <p>After deciding to switch careers, I thought about teaching. There is a saying that those who cannot achieve their first goal teach. I spent a few years teaching at the Pui Tak Center in Chicago. During that time, I also grabbed a Masters of Education from DePaul University. I learned I liked teaching adults much more than kids but in the adult teaching world, full time jobs were hard to come by or nonexistent.</p>
        <p>I ended up getting encouraged to get back into computers by a close friend and redicovered I had a lot of knowledge and that I loved the technology field. Since then, I've worked for a way to get back to technology and specifically Front End Web Development. I've been doing that the last few years and really love it. I'm currently working to be more full-stack as well as learning more about iOS development. I've always loved Augmented Reality and I'm working hard at getting Apple's ARKit knowledge under my belt.</p>
